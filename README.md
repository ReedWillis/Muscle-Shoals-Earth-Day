Muscle Shoals Earth Day Spinup Website
=============================

Reed Willis and Gage Bays collabrated on this project to build a website example for the muscle shoals earth day. We were in contact with Nancy Muse, the pperson in charge of the website. She gave us her ideas for the website and we made them come to lie!
----------------------------------------------

This website took several weeks to complete. It required lots of phone calls and real world experiences. Some of the requirments that Mrs. Nancy wished for was a photo gallery, the registration form, and her poster, along with many other things on the website. One of the issues that came about was the readability of this website, but Gage and I worked with the client and did everything to their desire, including fonts and layouts. 
----------------------------------------------

* ü¶≠¬† This was an honors college prject for CIS 376 at UNA.
* üìÖ¬† This website was done in March, 2025.
* ‚ùå  An error that we are fixing is the font of the mission statement and the text readability of the entire website.

### Here's mine: 

```html
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Import element definition and auto-register -->
  <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/zero-md@3?register"></script>
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <!-- Profit! -->
  <zero-md src="../README.md"></zero-md>
</body>

  <summary>Details about the issue</summary>
  <p>Gage and I used the link of a screenshot of the form as the form on the website, but our proffessor, Dr. Barry Cumbie, showed us how to link the actual pdf and that is much better because it is the actual thing that we were trying to link to in the first place.</p>
